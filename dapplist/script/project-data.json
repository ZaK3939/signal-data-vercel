With a stealth address, a payer can send Ether or ERC20 tokens to an address controlled by the receiver, but no one except the two parties know who that receiver is.\n\nOn chain, the transaction looks like a simple transfer to an otherwise unused address on the Ethereum network. Off chain, the sender has used a public key published by the receiver to generate the new address. By encrypting the data used to generate the address, and announcing it via the Umbra smart contract, the sender can let the receiver know they‚Äôve sent them a payment to a new stealth address. Only the receiver can generate the private key needed to withdraw the funds.\n\nBy leveraging meta-transactions, Umbra enables withdrawers to pay relayers for gas using the tokens they‚Äôve received. This avoids the need to fund stealth addresses with Ether before withdrawing",

Bug bounty programs enable developers to uncover vulnerabilities in their applications by rewarding hackers who identify them. These programs are prevalent in the Web2 space, where they often lack any form of payment guarantee for whitehats, allowing developers to sometimes underpay or refuse payment. BugLess operates within a deterministic RISC-V machine that boots Linux and accepts applications in any major programming language. Through a user-friendly web interface, anyone can submit and sponsor applications with ETH to incentivize hackers. All major wallets are supported. Hackers can test their exploits directly in the browser without needing to sign Web3 transactions. When a hacker discovers a valid exploit, they can initiate a transaction to transfer the reward to their account. BugLess does not require a specific format for the exploit; it can be in any language suitable for the application, such as Lua for a Lua library or SQL for the SQLite database engine. If no valid exploits are submitted by a specified deadline, sponsors may request a refund. Get ready to use BugLess, powered by Cartesi, for a much-needed guarantee of fairness in bug bounty programs!",

Newrl RWA enables reliable lending against real-world assets such as agri commodities and invoices. The real-world asset is tokenized first, with a two-step process of encrypted data storage on IPFS, followed by minting of the ERC-20 token on Polygon. This step corresponds in the real world to either the initiation of storage of the corresponding commodity or the signing of the invoice by a buyer (depending on which asset it is.)\nOnce tokenized, the owner gets an ERC-20 token of that commodity in their wallet on the polygon. They can then borrow against this on-chain as well as off-chain. In the off-chain variant, an intermediary platform enables the tokenization of fiat currency so that the lender can transfer it to the smart contract when lending. The smart contract transfers this stablecoin onwards to the borrower based on the collateral. The borrower can convert the stablecoin back to fiat currency using the on-ramp/off-ramp service provider.\nThe process is reversed while repaying. Upon repayment including the interest, the collateral token is released from the smart contract to the borrower. They can now take the commodity out of the storage and use it. Upon the exit of the commodity from the storage, the token corresponding to it is destroyed. In case of default, the token is transferred to the lender.",

Because it don't need the confirmation from the sending chain A to confirm the payment on chain B (were funds arrive).\n\n- It's also secure as it not depends on contracts on origin and destination chain, it just need a single relayer willing to offer service on the destination chain. Making smart-contracts risks much smaller as the bridging is not depended on many different contracts on many different chains, it just depended on one single contract as the settlement happens on a single dedicated chain.\n\nRelay now depends on the \"The Reservoir relayer\", so trust in that is needed, it's not the final destination for Relay protocol but a good beginning in building a fully decentralized system based on relayers which can act much cheaper and faster than other bridges, today. \n\n",

Playing on a board is fun, but you can also play mini games to get advantage of your opponents, complete quests to get resources, interact with your pet, boost your character, and many other things. Once in every few weeks, a new seasonal event is released, bringing new story, board, characters, pets, items, quests and other stuff.\n\nPixudi combines 2 business models: Free2Play and Play2Collect. It means that players don't need to pay any money to start playing but they can purchase Mystery Packs to enhance their gaming experience: get nicer characters and boost them, receive items, etc. Important note: there is no Pay-to-Win mechanics in Pixudi. No matter how many Mystery Packs you buy, victory is not guaranteed. All characters and items can be sold on a marketplace.\n\n",

As soon the collection is sold out, the owners get opportunity to stake their NFTs and get rewards through $bored tokens. There are plethora of utilities for the $bored tokens including purchase of merchendise, participating in voting rights and listing of $bored token in DEX to name a few.

We aim to create a launchpad for both technical and non-technical project founders, that will allow communities and projects access to all the options they need for a secure and successful deployment to the SushiSwap exchange.\n\nWith this in mind, development of MISO has led to the addition of some features not outlined in the initial proposal. Similar to other exchanges in the cryptocurrency market, SushiSwap was in need of a launchpad that aligns with the spirit of it's userbase - and the projects it wishes to offer. MISO will serve as the SushiSwap communities personal platform for projects to launch on, enabling projects and communities to know that all aspects of a launch are handled through trusted, open source contracts.\n\n",

The protocol is composed of a set of fully autonomous smart contracts that reside on the Polygon network and was launched in June 2022.\nAs opposed to other lending protocols that require the borrower to deposit collateral, Atlendis enables allowlisted borrowers to borrow without posting any collateral upfront. The unsecured nature of the loan exposes the lender to credit risk that is rewarded with a yield determined by the market's supply/demand dynamics. Atlendis partners with a credit scoring protocol to assess financial performance of borrowers on-chain, in a continuous and privacy conserving manner. From the borrower's perspective, unsecured borrowing allows for greater capital efficiency as well as greater flexibility to optimize their capital structure.",

Our solution bridges the entrenched world of centralized databases with the new world of distributed blockchain technologies.\nBlockchains provides a new frontier of development for enterprises, consumers and software developers. Due toits decentralized architecture, immutable ledger and highly secure framework, applications of the technology will impact industries ranging from finance and retail to personal identity and cryptocurrency. Covalent's solution will exponentially increase access to and adoption of distributed blockchain technologies for enterprise and consumer use cases.\nThe first version of Covalent was built in a weekend at a distributed systems hackathon in the fall of 2017. After winning the hackathon, we decided to turn it into a hosted service and start commercialization.\nOur team is comprised of industry veterans in database and distributed systems. Covalent is funded by leading venture investors, with over a decade of expertise building and scaling technology companies.\nCovalent is solving the data availability gap problem inhibiting the Ethereum blockchain. We provide on-chain data and analytics for blockchains (currently Ethereum), and right now, we're supporting the top DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols in the space -- Maker, Uniswap, Compound, dYdX, to name a few. We support the narrative, \"DeFi is Fintech 2.0,\" and that it will take the intermediaries away. Our goal is to build an indexing engine to search and make it relevant for the end-user.\nWe're currently building SafeKeeep using Covalent's API -- which solves the DeFi data availability nightmare. SafeKeep goes beyond account balances and positions to a full-blown record-keeping & PnL solution.",
